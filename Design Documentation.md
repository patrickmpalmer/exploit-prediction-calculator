##Introduction

The Exploit Prediction Systems (or EPS) consists of 4 main parts: front end, back end, data, and ML model. First I will describe how the system as a whole works after which I will explain the inner workings of each individual part.


##Overall Program Flow

The program is fairly simple in it’s flow. Starting from the user and moving backwards we have the front end web page that the user interacts with which communicates information to the user and takes user input and sends it to the back end. The back end then uses the trained ML model to make a prediction and sends it back to the front end. The data was used in the training of the ML model. The ML model was trained before deployment and is used to make predictions based on the user input.


##Component Breakdown

Front End: The front end runs on html and uses JS to display information to the user.
Back End: The back end is a Flask application written in Python that takes the user inputs, parses the input, encodes it, and uses the ML model to make predictions. After that, it takes the output from the model and structures it so that it can then be sent back to the front end to be displayed to the user.
Data: The data was taken from the NIST database and an exploited vulnerability database.
ML Model: The ML model is a fully connected neural network that was trained in Keras. It ends up being a .h5 file that is loaded by the back end.
